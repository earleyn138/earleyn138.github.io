                  <h3>simulating and evaluating resonant scattering for XRISM observations</h3>
                  <p>Currently performing and optimizing Monte Carlo simulations of resonant scattering with the goal of properly modeling and interpreting X-ray spectra of high-priority cluster targets set to be observed by the XRISM observatory when it launches in 2023.</p>

                  <h3>a long-term study of ULXs</h3>
									<p>I performed a comprehensive spectral modeling study of three ultraluminous X-ray sources in a nearby analog to the Milky Way, NGC 891. I analyzed the complete archival Chandra and XMM-Newton datasets from 2000-2017, filling in gaps in the literature for previously known sources and discovering a new transient source in the process which faded from view over the course of two months. First-author publication: </p>

									<h3>exoplanet detection with TESS</h3>
									<p>Second year spring and summer, developed a Python-based pipeline that loaded in, detrended, and fit transit models to light curves of observational targets in TESS Full Frame Images. Didn't find any planets, but found a few eclipsing binaries. </p>

									<h3>detector physics with SPT-3G</h3>
									<p>Summer of my first year at Argonne National Laboratory, cooling transition-edge sensors down to mK with adiabatic demagnetization refrigerators and analyzing R(T) curves. </p>
